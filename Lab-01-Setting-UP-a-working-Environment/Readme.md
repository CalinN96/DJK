# Setting Up a Working Environment

In this chapter, we are going to prepare our personal or working environment to work efficiently and effectively with Docker. We will discuss in detail how to set up an ideal environment for developers, DevOps, and operators that can be used when working with Docker containers.

For this chapter, you will need a laptop or a workstation with either macOS or Windows, preferably Windows 10 Professional, installed. You should also have free internet access to download applications and permission to install those applications on your laptop.

It is also possible to follow along with this book if you have a Linux distribution as your operating system, such as Ubuntu 18.04 or newer. I will try to indicate where commands and samples differ significantly from the ones on macOS or Windows.



- The Linux command shell
- PowerShell for Windows
- Installing and using a package manager
- Installing Git and cloning the code repository
- Choosing and installing a code editor
- Installing Docker for Desktop on macOS or Windows
- Installing Docker Toolbox
- Installing Minikube
