# **Advanced Docker Usage Scenarios**
In the last chapter, we showed you how you can use tools to perform administrative tasks without having to install those tools on the host computer. We also illustrated the use of containers that host and run test scripts or code used to test and validate application services running in containers. Finally, we guided you through the task of building a simple Docker-based CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins as the automation server.

In this chapter, we will introduce advanced tips, tricks, and concepts that are useful when containerizing complex distributed applications, or when using Docker to automate sophisticated tasks.

This is a quick overview of all of the subjects we are going to touch on in this chapter:

- [All of the tips and tricks of a Docker pro](All-of-the-tips-and-tricks-of-a-Docker-pro.md)
- [Running your Terminal in a remote container and accessing it via HTTPS]()
- [Running your development environment inside a container](Running-your-development-environment-inside-a-container.md)
- [Running your code editor in a remote container and accessing it via HTTPS](Running-your-code-editor-in-a-remote-container-and-accessing-it-via-HTTPS.md)

# Technical requirements
In this chapter, if you want to follow along with the code, you need Docker for Desktop on your Mac or Windows machine and the Visual Studio Code editor. The example will also work on a Linux machine with Docker and Visual Studio Code installed. Docker Toolbox is not supported in this chapter.
