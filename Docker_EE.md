# Docker EE

The Docker Enterprise Edition consists of the **Universal Control Plane (UCP)** and the **Docker Trusted Registry (DTR)**, both of which run on top of Docker Swarm. Both are swarm applications. Docker EE builds on top of the upstream components of the Moby project and adds enterprise-grade features such as **role-based access control (RBAC)**, multi-tenancy, mixed clusters of **Docker swarm** and **Kubernetes**, web-based UI, and content trust, as well as image scanning on top.
