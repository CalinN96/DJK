# Deploying, Updating, and Securing an Application with Kubernetes

In the previous chapter, we learned about the basics of the container orchestrator, Kubernetes. We got a high-level overview of the architecture of Kubernetes and learned a lot about the important objects used by Kubernetes to define and manage a containerized application. 

In this chapter, we will learn how to deploy, update, and scale applications into a Kubernetes cluster. We will also explain how zero downtime deployments are achieved to enable disruption-free updates and rollbacks of mission-critical applications. Finally, we will introduce Kubernetes secrets as a means to configure services and protect sensitive data.

# This chapter covers the following topics:

- Deploying a first application
- Defining liveness and readiness
- Zero downtime deployments
- Kubernetes secrets
