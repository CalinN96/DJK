# Running a Containerized App in the Cloud
In the previous chapter, we learned how to deploy, monitor, and troubleshoot an application in production.

In this chapter, we will give an overview of some of the most popular ways of running containerized applications in the cloud. We will explore self-hosting and hosted solutions and discuss their pros and cons. Fully managed offerings from vendors such as Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Engine will be briefly discussed.

Here are the topics we will be discussing in this chapter:

- [Deploying and using Docker Enterprise Edition (EE) on Amazon Web Services (AWS)](Deploying-and-using-Docker-Enterprise-Edition.md)
- [Exploring Microsoft's Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](ExploringMicrosoft-s-Azure-Kubernetes-Service-AKS.md)
- Understanding Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

# Technical requirements
We are going to use AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud in this chapter. Therefore, it is necessary to have an account for each platform. If you do not have an existing account, you can ask for a trial account for all of these cloud providers.
