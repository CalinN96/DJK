# **Data Volumes and Configuration**
In the last chapter, we learned how to build and share our own container images. Particular focus was placed on how to build images that are as small as possible by only containing artifacts that are really needed by the containerized application.

In this chapter, we are going to learn how we can work with stateful containersâ€”that is, containers that consume and produce data. We will also learn how to configure our containers at runtime and at image build time, using environment variables and config files.

Here is a list of the topics we're going to discuss:

Creating and mounting data volumes
Sharing data between containers
Using host volumes
Defining volumes in images
Configuring containers
