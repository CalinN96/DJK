# Docker CE

Part of the Docker Community Edition are products such as the Docker Toolbox and Docker for Desktop with its editions for Mac and Windows. All these products are mainly targeted at developers.

Docker for Desktop is an easy-to-install desktop application that can be used to build, debug, and test Dockerized applications or services on a macOS or Windows machine. Docker for macOS and Docker for Windows are complete development environments that are deeply integrated with their respective hypervisor framework, network, and filesystem. These tools are the fastest and most reliable way to run Docker on a Mac or Windows.

Under the CE umbrella, there are also two products that are more geared toward operations engineers. These products are Docker for Azure and Docker for AWS.

For example, with Docker for Azure, which is a native Azure application, you can set up Docker in a few clicks, optimized for and integrated with underlying Azure Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) services. It helps operations engineers accelerate time to productivity when building and running Docker applications in Azure.

Docker for AWS works very similarly but for Amazon's cloud.
